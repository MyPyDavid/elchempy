DP-DRT: Deep Prior Distribution of Relaxation Times

This repository contains the code for one example as shown in the paper "The Deep-Prior Distribution of Relaxation Times" <u>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ab631a/meta</u>.

# Introduction
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is the established tool for the study of many electrochemical experiments[1]. While the analysis of EIS data is challenging, this can be assisted by the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) method[2-6]. However, obtaining the DRT is difficult as the underlying problem is ill-posed. Inspired by recent advances in image analysis, we develop a completely new approach, named the deep prior distribution of relaxation time (DP-DRT), for the deconvolution of the EIS to obtain the DRT[7]. The DP-DRT uses a deep neural network fed with a single random input to deconvolve the DRT and fit the EIS data. The DP-DRT has the peculiarity of having a number of parameters much larger than the number of observations. Further, unlike most supervised deep learning models, large datasets are not needed as the DP-DRT is trained against a single available EIS spectrum. The DP-DRT was successfully tested against both synthetic and real experiments displaying considerable promise and opportunities for extensions.

* **Figure_2.ipynb**: shows how to recover DRT from impedance synthesized using one ZARC element consisting of a resistance placed in parallel to a constant phase element (CPE). The frequency range is from 1E-4 Hz to 1E4 Hz with 10 points per decade (ppd).
